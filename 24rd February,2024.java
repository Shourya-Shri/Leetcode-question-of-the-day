/*
You are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.

Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.
